            This site that you are looking at is coded from scraaatch by <i>yours truly</i> as a designer, in an attempt to put my thoughts into a cohesive collection, with the exception of Time | <i>Space</i>, in which I received help from my friend regarding the JavaScript file. <br><br>
            As much as I wanted to write the JS file all by myself, it is, in fact, no easy  job for a designer to figure out. Yet I do hope to master the language, some day. <br> My favorite recent piece of content also happens to be <a href="time-space.html">Time | <i>Space</i></a>, as it contains videos that I took over the past several years. It has an indefinite calming effect on me. <br><br>
            I hope you enjoy the chapters.
            
            <br><br>
            Optimistically yours,<br>
            Chi.
